#' Functions for Benchmarking Time Series Prediction
#'
#' Functions for time series preprocessing, decomposition, prediction and 
#' accuracy assessment using automatic linear modelling. The generated linear models 
#' and its yielded prediction errors can be used for benchmarking other time series 
#' prediction methods and for creating a demand for the refinement of such methods. 
#' For this purpose, benchmark data from prediction competitions may be used.
