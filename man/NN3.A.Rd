\description{
The NN3 Competition dataset composed of monthly time series drawn from
homogeneous population of real empirical business time series.
}
\details{
The NN3 Competition's Dataset A contains 111 different monthly time series.
Each of this time series possess from 50 to 126 observations. Each
competitor in NN3 was asked to predict the next 18 corresponding
observations of each times series (\code{\link{NN3.A.cont}}). The
performance evaluation done by NN3 Competition was based on the mean SMAPE
error of prediction found by the competitors across all time series.
